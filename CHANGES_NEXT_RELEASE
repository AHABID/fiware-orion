- Add: Rush can now be used as relayer for the broker, using the option '-rush' (Issue #251)
- Add: Custom metadata support (issue #252)
- Fix: Raising error on updateContext with location metadata doesn't involve actual change of location attribute (issue #351)
- Fix: The functionality to change the Log configuration via REST had stopped working. Fixed.
- FIX: The Log configuration via REST used "/log/traceLevel", whereas the documentation states "/log/trace".
       Updated the broker to support both "/log/trace" and "/log/traceLevel"
