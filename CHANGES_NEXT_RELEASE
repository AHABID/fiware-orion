- Fix: correct error payload using errorCode (previously orionError was used) in POST /v1/queryContext and POST /v1/updateContext in some cases
- Fix: bug in metadata compound value rendering in NGSIv2 (sometimes "toplevel" key was wrongly inserted in the resulting JSON object)
- Fix: correct processing of JSON special characters  (such as \n) in NGSIv2 rendering (#3280)
- Hardening: modification of the URL parsing mechanism, making it more efficient, and the source code easier to follow (#3109, step 1)
- Deprecated: NGSIv1 API (along with related CLI parameters: -strictNgsiv1Ids and -ngsiv1Autocast)
- Hardening: refactor NGSIv2 rendering code (throughput increase up to 33%/365% in entities/subscriptions rendering intensive scenarios) (#1298)

- Fix: pre-update metadata content included in notifications (and it shouldn't) (#3310)
- Fix: duplicated items in ?attrs and ?metadata URI params (and "attrs" and "metadata" in POST /v2/op/query and subscriptions) cause duplicated keys in responses/notifications (#3311)
- Fix: dateCreated and dateModified included in initial notification (#3182)
