- Add: support for MongoDB 2.6 (MongoDB 2.4 should *not* be used any longer as inverted geo-queries will not work in that version) (Issue #415)
- Add: context providers full functionality (Issue #787)
- Fix: unhardwire format to forward requests to context providers (Issue #722)
- Fix: using proper GJSON for location.coords entities information (Issue #415)
- Fix: attribute storing in DB (from vector to keymap) to enable CB Active/Active architectures (Issue #878)
- Fix: simplifying 'GET /v1/contextTypes' and 'GET /v1/contextTypes/<entityType>' operations, removing attribute types (no longer used as attribute identification since 0.17.0). As
       a consequence, the 'attributeFormat' URI parameter is no longer needed in the 'GET /v1/contextTypes', so it is ignored.
- Fix: DELETE updates are resolved locally, previously they were forwarded to CPrs (Issue #755)
- Fix: The URI parameter 'notifyFormat' is now treated the same way for subscriptions as for registrations.
