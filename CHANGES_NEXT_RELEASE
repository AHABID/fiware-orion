- Fix: over-logging of Runtime Error traces not representing actual error (#2597)
- Fix: support attributes with double underscore as part of the name (#2453)
- Fix: threadpool mode was not actually used, even if -notificationMode is set so; this fix solves the problem for not-custom notifications (partial fix for #2622)
