  - Found and fixed three bugs during the process:
    - registerContextRequest rendering had no comma for JSON between ContextRegistrations
    - registrationId mandatory for registerContextResponse
    - ContextRegistrationAttribute had an incorrect tag for the metadata

  - Duration no longer returned in response payload if the incoming duration was invalid
  - Fixed the check of RegisterProviderRequest which was incorrect.
    This fix improves error responses for ngsi9 convenience oprrations

o PR #171 kzangeli Wed dic 19 00:25:37 CET 2013
  - Fixed a bug regarding the 'default' value of 'subscriptionId'.
    Before this PR, in case of an undefined subscriptionId, the string 'No SubscriptionId' was used.
    This doesn't follow the XSD and has been changed to '000000000000000000000000'.
    This can happen e.g. if a subscription request fails and no new subscriptionId is generated but
    as the XSD forces the response to contain a subscriptionId, the zeroed string is returned as
    some kind of 'subscriptionId dummy'.

    Perhaps the XSD/OMA Specification should be changed and the subscriptionId should be omitted
    in these erroneous cases ... ?
