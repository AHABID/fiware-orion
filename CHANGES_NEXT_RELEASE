o Fix:  errors in JSON rendering for '/statistics' and '/version' fixed (Issue #428).
o Fix:  using same location attribute in UPDATE fails (issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24431177/ge-orion-context-broker-when-we-make-an-update-of-the-entity-does-not-allow-us)
o Fix:  Context Broker no crashed anymore due to different tenant names but equal in insensitve case (workaround in Issue #431).
o Logging modifications (Issue #428):
   o The name of the log file has been changed from contextBrokerLog to contextBroker.log
   o Changed the log line format to use a key-value approach
   o Added LM_I, for transactions. Each time a new transaction is initiated, an LM_I is issued.
     Upon terminating each transaction, another LM_I is issued to reflect this.
   o All log lines contain the id of the current transaction, or N/A if no transaction is in progress
   o Changed the time reference to localtime (previously GMT was used)
   o Stopped using LM_RE, LM_V* and _LM_RVE and removed tho CLI options -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv, -vvvvv
   o Added an LM_I for when thr broker starts and another when it exits (in a controlled manner).
