       the 'csub' collection, assuming that the field can be either int or long (it is always written as long)
- Fix: number/bool correct rendering in NGSIv1 compound values
- Fix: ONCHANGE notifications triggered by update context operation are filled avoiding querying entities collection (#881)
- Fix: wrong notification values (duplicated) when triggering update context operations are too close (race condition)
