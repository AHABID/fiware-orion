- Add: support for MongoDB 2.6/3.0 (MongoDB 2.4 should *not* be used any longer as inverted geo-queries will not work in that version) (Issue #415)
- Add: context providers full functionality (Issue #787)
- Fix: unhardwire format to forward requests to context providers (Issue #722)
- Fix: using proper GJSON for location.coords entities information (Issue #415)
- Fix: attribute storing in DB (from vector to keymap) to enable CB Active/Active architectures (Issue #878)
- Fix: simplifying 'GET /v1/contextTypes' and 'GET /v1/contextTypes/<entityType>' operations, removing attribute types (no longer used as attribute identification since 0.17.0). As
       a consequence, the 'attributeFormat' URI parameter is no longer needed in the 'GET /v1/contextTypes', so it is ignored.
- Fix: DELETE updates are resolved locally, previously they were forwarded to CPrs (Issue #755)
- Fix: The URI parameter 'notifyFormat' is now treated the same way for subscriptions as for registrations.
- Add: Notifications and forwarded queries/updates are now controlled by a timeout. (Issue #880)
       The default timeout is set to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), including connection, writing the request and reading the response.
       To change this timeout, a new CLI option '-httpTimeout' has been added to the broker.
- Fix: Changed the name, type and unit of the CLI option '-timeout'.
       New name:  '-dbTimeout',
       New type:  integer (was a floating point number)
       New unit:  milliseconds (was seconds, but decimals were allowed as it was a floating point number)
- Add: Updates of ngsi9 subscriptions now also support the URI parameter notifyFormat
