- Fix: Correct rendering of response to convop "POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}/attributes/{attributeName} (Issue #772)
- Fix: All convenience operations to use the service routines of standard operations (Issue #117)
- Fix: Made 'POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}' and 'POST /v1/contextEntities' accept entity::id and entity::type
       in both payload and URL, as long as the values coincide.
- Fix: A few more of the 'responses without entityId::type filled in' found and fixed (Issue #585)
