Add: New convop: "POST /v1/contextEntities" (Issue #613).
     Note also that AppendContextElementRequest has been added an EntityId field.
Add: Convenience operations that respond with AppendContextElementResponse now get the
     EntityId info included in the response.
Fix: Changed max-length of tenant names from 20 characters to 50.
     Also the database name (CLI-option '-db') has been given a maximum length of 10 bytes. (Issue #616)
Fix: No longer responding with 'Service not found: $URL'. (Issue #619)
Fix: Requests with payload containing forbidden characters are now rejected. (Issue #619)
Fix: Fixed a bug that made the broker crash on problems with EntityId during XML-parse (in very rare situations).
Fix: 'WSG84' identifier changed to 'WGS84' (it was a typo), although the old one is still supported to ensure backward compatibility. (Issue #627)
Fix: Fixed a leak for each forwarding of messages to Context Providers.
Add: New name for URI param 'attributesFormat': 'attributeFormat' (better English).
     The old name will be supported as well. (Issue #633)
Fix: Attribute type is no longer used as attribute "identification key" (from now on, only name is used for that purpose) (Issue #640)
Add: Fiware-ServicePath '#' syntax for including path children in the query (without '#' only the service path itself is included). (Issue #646)
Add: "/" is used as implicit service path for entities. (Issue #646)
Add: Queries without Fiware-ServicePath are resolved on "/#" implicitly (i.e. all the paths). (Issue #646)
Fix: Changed max-length of service path elements from 10 characteres to 50. (Issue #649)
Fix: Service path is no longer ignored at entity creation time for entities without type. (Issue #642)

Fix: Using 443 as default port for "https" notifications. (Issue #639)
