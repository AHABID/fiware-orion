- Fix: Correct rendering of response to convop "POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}/attributes/{attributeName} (Issue #772)
- Fix: All convenience operations to use the service routines of standard operations (Issue #117)
- Fix: Made 'POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}' and 'POST /v1/contextEntities' accept entity::id and entity::type in payload,
       as long as they coincide with the entityId::id and entityId::type in the payload.
