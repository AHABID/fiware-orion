# 01. Registration of E1 without Legacy Forwarding, for the accumulator - forward to be in NGSIv2 format
# 02. Query of entities with id E1 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond, but a forward is provoked
# 03. Dump and reset the accumulator, see the forwarded query in NGSIv2 format
#
# FIXME: Due to a bug in Orion, the forward provoked by the query of step 2 makes the broker send not one but TWO forwarded
#        request of the query to the accumulator.
#        This is a bug of the broker that is also present in V1 forwarding and it is 'more or less acceptable', but should be fixed some day ...
#
#
# FIXME: It seems like older versions of libcurl (CentOS 7 used version 7.29 of libcurl) contain a bug that makes the Content-Type
#        always be added to the sent message, also when the Content-Type is EMPTY (which should inhibit this behaviour).
#        The result of this bug is that the line
#          Content-Type:
#        is a part of forwarded messages.
#        In newer versions of libcurl this haqs been fixed (Ubuntu 18.04 uses libcurl 7.58)
#        For now, a "grep -v 'Content-Type'" is added to calls of accumulatorDump as a work-around.
#        The real fix would be to use a newer version of libcurl in CentOS 7 (Travis, Jenkins)
